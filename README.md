# SwiftXRT_extraction
Quick spectral extraction of multiple Swift/XRT observations.

This script uses resources and tasks provided by the Swift team (e.g., see [here](http://www.swift.ac.uk/analysis/xrt/spectra.php)) to quickly go through reduction and spectral extraction for multiple XRT observations.
